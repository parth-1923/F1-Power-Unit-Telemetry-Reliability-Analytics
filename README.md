# F1-Power-Unit-Telemetry-Reliability-Analytics
This project simulates Formula 1 Power Unit (PU) telemetry and reliability analysis. Using a synthetic dataset of engine performance metrics across multiple races, the goal is to evaluate power unit health, detect anomalies, and identify reliability trade-offs.

The project demonstrates how data analysis, statistical modeling, and visualization can support decision-making in high-performance motorsport environments
